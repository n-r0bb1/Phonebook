The Phonebook Application is a command-line program written in C that allows users to manage a phonebook through an interactive menu-based interface. Users can add, search, and delete contacts, with the data stored persistently in a file. This project was created to practice C programming, particularly focusing on data processing, file handling, and developing an interactive command-line interface.

Features
Add Contacts: Add new contacts (name and phone number) to the phonebook.
Search Contacts: Search for contacts by name or phone number.
Delete Contacts: Remove contacts from the phonebook.
List Contacts: Display all stored contacts in the phonebook.
File Handling: All contact data is stored in a text file to maintain persistence across sessions.
Interactive Command-Line Interface: Users can interact with the application through an intuitive, menu-driven interface.
